# [Project Name] - A Minimalist Collection of Math Problems

[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

A simple, open-source list of math problems, free for any use.

## About This Project

This repository contains a plain list of mathematical problems. There is no extra data, no categories, no solutionsâ€”just the questions themselves. It is designed for maximum simplicity and ease of use.

## File Format

All problems are stored in a single plain text file: `problems.txt`.

Each line in the file is a separate problem.

#### Example (`problems.txt`):

```text
Solve the equation: $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$.
What is the value of $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta)$?
Find the derivative of $f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 4$.
If a triangle has sides of length 3, 4, and 5, is it a right-angled triangle?
````

## How to Use

Clone this repository to get the `problems.txt` file. You can then read the file line by line in any programming language or text editor.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME].git
```

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome\!

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Add your new problems to the end of the `problems.txt` file. Please ensure each problem is on a new line.
3.  Submit a **Pull Request**.

Please make sure any problems you contribute are free of copyright restrictions.

### Summary of Changes:

* **Simplicity:** The entire description now emphasizes the minimalist nature of the project.
* **File Format:** The `Data Structure` section has been replaced with a `File Format` section that clearly explains the "one problem per line" structure in a `problems.txt` file.
* **Example:** The example now shows a plain text list, not JSON.
* **Contributing:** The instructions for contributing have been simplified to match the file format.
